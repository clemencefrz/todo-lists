Homework 

Build a todo list with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Instructions

1. **Setup the Project**:
   - Ensure you have a modern web browser installed.
   - Open the `index.html` file in your browser to view the todo list.

2. **Todo List Implementation**:
   - The todo list is implemented in `index.html`, `styles.css`, and `script.js`.
   - It includes the following features:
     - Display a list of tasks.
     - Add new tasks using the input field and the "Add" button.
     - Delete tasks using the "Delete" button next to each task.

3. **Key Components**:
   - The `todos` array stores the list of tasks.
   - The `addTodo` function adds a new task to the list and clears the input field.
   - The `deleteTodo` function removes a task from the list based on its index.

4. **Accessibility**:
   - Ensure that all interactive elements (inputs, buttons) have appropriate labels and ARIA attributes for better accessibility.

5. **Testing**:
   - Test the application to ensure that adding and deleting tasks work as expected.

6. **Deployment**:
   - Once satisfied with the implementation, deploy the project to your preferred hosting service.

Happy coding!
